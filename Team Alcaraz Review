1. The homepage (index.html) is clean, organized, and visually engaging. It effectively links users to both features.
2. The Deck of Cards game works smoothly, with successful API integration, draw and shuffle features.
3. The Dungeons & Dragons API Explorer is very impressive—dynamic loading, clear layout, and even supports nested JSON display.
4. Styling via style.css is consistent, responsive, and user-friendly across pages.

Minor Suggestions:
1. The README.md file does not contain any instructions or description of the project. Including setup steps or a short summary would be helpful for future users or developers.
2. The text.txt file is empty and doesn’t appear to serve a purpose—consider removing it or replacing it with relevant content.
